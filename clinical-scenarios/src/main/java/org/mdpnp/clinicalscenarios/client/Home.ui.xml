	<h2>Welcome to the Clinical Scenario Repository.</h2>  

	<p class="welcomeText">A <em>clinical scenario</em> is a brief description of a clinical situation or event. The purpose of the clinical scenario is 
	to provide a background and illustrate the need for the development of technical solutions. Solutions for these 
	scenarios will be generalizable and will create building blocks for interoperability to address many other healthcare needs.</p>

	<p class="welcomeText">The aim of this open repository of Clinical Scenarios Website is to provide a web-based user interface that will allow clinicians, clinical engineers, and other users to enter, revise, annotate, and maintain clinical scenarios, thus identifying specific clinical and technical challenges.</p>
	
	<p class="welcomeText">The Clinical Scenario Repository, developed by the <a href="http://www.mdpnp.org/" target="_blank">MD PnP</a> Program under TATRC award W81XWH-09-1-0705, is currently a <em>beta</em> version. This pilot repository is still assessing stability, usability and is being upgraded regularly (Any feedback is welcomed and appreciated).</p>

	<p class="welcomeText">Current repository version is Version 0.9.6.2. Latest update on 10/29/2013</p>
